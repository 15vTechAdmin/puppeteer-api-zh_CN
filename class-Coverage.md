### class: Coverage

Coverage gathers information about parts of JavaScript and CSS that were used by the page.

An example of using JavaScript and CSS coverage to get percentage of initially
executed code:

```js
// Enable both JavaScript and CSS coverage
await Promise.all([
  page.coverage.startJSCoverage(),
  page.coverage.startCSSCoverage()
]);
// Navigate to page
await page.goto('https://example.com');
// Disable both JavaScript and CSS coverage
const [jsCoverage, cssCoverage] = await Promise.all([
  page.coverage.stopJSCoverage(),
  page.coverage.stopCSSCoverage(),
]);
let totalBytes = 0;
let usedBytes = 0;
const coverage = [...jsCoverage, ...cssCoverage];
for (const entry of coverage) {
  totalBytes += entry.text.length;
  for (const range of entry.ranges)
    usedBytes += range.end - range.start - 1;
}
console.log(`Bytes used: ${usedBytes / totalBytes * 100}%`);
```

#### coverage.startCSSCoverage(options)
- `options` <[Object]>  Set of configurable options for coverage
  - `resetOnNavigation` <[boolean]> Whether to reset coverage on every navigation. Defaults to `true`.
- returns: <[Promise]> Promise that resolves when coverage is started

#### coverage.startJSCoverage(options)
- `options` <[Object]>  Set of configurable options for coverage
  - `resetOnNavigation` <[boolean]> Whether to reset coverage on every navigation. Defaults to `true`.
- returns: <[Promise]> Promise that resolves when coverage is started

#### coverage.stopCSSCoverage()
- returns: <[Promise]<[Array]<[Object]>>> Promise that resolves to the array of coverage reports for all stylesheets
  - `url` <[string]> StyleSheet URL
  - `text` <[string]> StyleSheet content
  - `ranges` <[Array]<[Object]>> StyleSheet ranges that were used. Ranges are sorted and non-overlapping.
    - `start` <[number]> A start offset in text, inclusive
    - `end` <[number]> An end offset in text, exclusive

> **NOTE** CSS Coverage doesn't include dynamically injected style tags without sourceURLs.

#### coverage.stopJSCoverage()
- returns: <[Promise]<[Array]<[Object]>>> Promise that resolves to the array of coverage reports for all non-anonymous scripts
  - `url` <[string]> Script URL
  - `text` <[string]> Script content
  - `ranges` <[Array]<[Object]>> Script ranges that were executed. Ranges are sorted and non-overlapping.
    - `start` <[number]> A start offset in text, inclusive
    - `end` <[number]> An end offset in text, exclusive

> **NOTE** JavaScript Coverage doesn't include anonymous scripts. However, scripts with sourceURLs are
reported.
