### class: Keyboard

Keyboard provides an api for managing a virtual keyboard. The high level api is [`keyboard.type`](#keyboardtypetext-options), which takes raw characters and generates proper keydown, keypress/input, and keyup events on your page.

Keyboard 提供一个接口来管理虚拟键盘. 高级接口为 [`keyboard.type`](#keyboardtypetext-options), 其接收原始字符, 然后在你的页面上生成对应的 keydown, keypress/input, 和  keyup 事件.

For finer control, you can use [`keyboard.down`](#keyboarddownkey-options), [`keyboard.up`](#keyboardupkey), and [`keyboard.sendCharacter`](#keyboardsendcharacterchar) to manually fire events as if they were generated from a real keyboard.

为了更精细的控制(虚拟键盘), 你可以使用 [`keyboard.down`](#keyboarddownkey-options), [`keyboard.up`](#keyboardupkey) 和 [`keyboard.sendCharacter`](#keyboardsendcharacterchar) 来手动触发事件, 就好像这些事件是由真实的键盘生成的.

An example of holding down `Shift` in order to select and delete some text:
```js
await page.keyboard.type('Hello World!');
await page.keyboard.press('ArrowLeft');

await page.keyboard.down('Shift');
for (let i = 0; i < ' World'.length; i++)
  await page.keyboard.press('ArrowLeft');
await page.keyboard.up('Shift');

await page.keyboard.press('Backspace');
// Result text will end up saying 'Hello!'
```

An example of pressing `A`
```js
await page.keyboard.down('Shift');
await page.keyboard.press('KeyA');
await page.keyboard.up('Shift');
```

> **NOTE** On MacOS, keyboard shortcuts like `⌘ A` -> Select All do not work. See [#1313](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/issues/1313)

#### keyboard.down(key[, options])
- `key` <[string]> Name of key to press, such as `ArrowLeft`. See [USKeyboardLayout] for a list of all key names.
- `options` <[Object]>
  - `text` <[string]> If specified, generates an input event with this text.
- returns: <[Promise]>

Dispatches a `keydown` event.

If `key` is a single character and no modifier keys besides `Shift` are being held down, a `keypress`/`input` event will also generated. The `text` option can be specified to force an input event to be generated.

If `key` is a modifier key, `Shift`, `Meta`, `Control`, or `Alt`, subsequent key presses will be sent with that modifier active. To release the modifier key, use [`keyboard.up`](#keyboardupkey).

After the key is pressed once, subsequent calls to [`keyboard.down`](#keyboarddownkey-options) will have [repeat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/repeat) set to true. To release the key, use [`keyboard.up`](#keyboardupkey).

> **NOTE** Modifier keys DO influence `keyboard.down`. Holding down `Shift` will type the text in upper case.

#### keyboard.press(key[, options])
- `key` <[string]> Name of key to press, such as `ArrowLeft`. See [USKeyboardLayout] for a list of all key names.
- `options` <[Object]>
  - `text` <[string]> If specified, generates an input event with this text.
  - `delay` <[number]> Time to wait between `keydown` and `keyup` in milliseconds. Defaults to 0.
- returns: <[Promise]>

If `key` is a single character and no modifier keys besides `Shift` are being held down, a `keypress`/`input` event will also generated. The `text` option can be specified to force an input event to be generated.

> **NOTE** Modifier keys DO effect `elementHandle.press`. Holding down `Shift` will type the text in upper case.

Shortcut for [`keyboard.down`](#keyboarddownkey-options) and [`keyboard.up`](#keyboardupkey).

#### keyboard.sendCharacter(char)
- `char` <[string]> Character to send into the page.
- returns: <[Promise]>

Dispatches a `keypress` and `input` event. This does not send a `keydown` or `keyup` event.

```js
page.keyboard.sendCharacter('嗨');
```

> **NOTE** Modifier keys DO NOT effect `keyboard.sendCharacter`. Holding down `Shift` will not type the text in upper case.

#### keyboard.type(text, options)
- `text` <[string]> A text to type into a focused element.
- `options` <[Object]>
  - `delay` <[number]> Time to wait between key presses in milliseconds. Defaults to 0.
- returns: <[Promise]>

Sends a `keydown`, `keypress`/`input`, and `keyup` event for each character in the text.

To press a special key, like `Control` or `ArrowDown`, use [`keyboard.press`](#keyboardpresskey-options).

```js
page.keyboard.type('Hello'); // Types instantly
page.keyboard.type('World', {delay: 100}); // Types slower, like a user
```

> **NOTE** Modifier keys DO NOT effect `keyboard.type`. Holding down `Shift` will not type the text in upper case.

#### keyboard.up(key)
- `key` <[string]> Name of key to release, such as `ArrowLeft`. See [USKeyboardLayout] for a list of all key names.
- returns: <[Promise]>

Dispatches a `keyup` event.
